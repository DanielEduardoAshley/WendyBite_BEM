                The series revolves around four older,
                single women (three widows and one
                divorcée) sharing a house in Miami,
                Florida. The owner of the house is a widow
                named Blanche Devereaux (Rue
                McClanahan), who was joined by fellow
                widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and
                divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).
                They both responded to a room-for-rent
                ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery
                store. In the pilot episode, the women had
                a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin),
                who was subsequently removed.[5]
                The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty),
                after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>
