    The series revolves around four older, <br>
    single women (three widows and one <br>
    divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, <br>
    Florida. The owner of the house is a widow<br>
     named Blanche Devereaux (Rue <br>
    McClanahan), who was joined by fellow <br>
    widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and <br>
    divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).<br>
     They both responded to a room-for-rent <br>
     ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery <br>
     store. In the pilot episode, the women had <br>
     a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin),<br>
      who was subsequently removed.[5]<br> 
      The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty),<br>
      after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.<br>

<p>Thank You for being a friend. Travel down a road and back again. Your heart <br>
    is true, you're a pal and a confidante.And if you threw a party, invited everyone <br>
    you knew, you would see the biggest gift would be from me and the card<br> 
    attached would say, Thank You For Being a Friend!</p>
